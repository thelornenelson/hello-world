Now adding from Google Cloud computing. I used git fetch to get the latest status of the remote repository and
then git pull to update the local to match. Now editing this and I'll commit and push back to remote.

Well not sure what happened there... apparently I just erased the entire fire. Whoops. Note sure how to
revert to a previous commit.

We'll find out.

TLN

Let's test a new commit.

Testing git on the new Macbook.

Still testing...

Testing pull...

Let's see how much I remember.

Aha, apparently git rm not only removed the local file, but erased it from the whole repository. Good to know!
